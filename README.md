**RSA Playground**

This project is part of Prof. Dr. Hanaa Hachimi's cryptography subject Master SSI first year at Ensa Kenitra.

**Description:**
RSA Playground is a Java application designed to demonstrate the key features of the RSA algorithm. It allows users to generate RSA key pairs, encrypt and decrypt text, and encrypt and decrypt text files. The application utilizes JavaFX for the user interface and requires the JFoenix library to be imported.

**Setup:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the JFoenix library JAR located in the `jar` folder.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
4. Run the `HomeController.java` file to launch the application.

**Usage:**
1. Generate RSA key pairs by clicking the "Generate Keys" button and selecting the desired key length.
2. Encrypt text or files using the public key.
3. Decrypt encrypted text or files using the private key.

**Note:**
- Ensure that the JFoenix library is correctly imported to avoid any compilation errors.
- For file encryption and decryption, make sure to select the appropriate files and follow the on-screen instructions.
